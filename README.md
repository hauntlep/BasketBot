A simple python discord bot that runs a game called "ReactCollect"

With 128 reactions, all of different rarities, the goal is to collect them all!

A user can start collecting with the command /register, and then they can send messages as normal and randomly collect reactions.

A reactions rarity increases based off of its index in the list of reactions, so the first reaction is the most common, and the last is the rarest.

The bot also has a leaderboard, which can be accessed with the command /leaderboard. The leaderboard shows the top 10 users by either reactions collected or shop credits.

The bot also has a help command, which can be accessed with the command /help. The help command shows all of the commands that the bot has.
